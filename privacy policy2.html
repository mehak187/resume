                       <p>By using RateMyResume AI, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, in accordance with applicable data privacy laws such as the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
                       <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA): CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. It applies to any person or company in the United States (and potentially the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from California consumers. Users can refer to the CalOPPA website for more information on their rights and protections under this law.</p>
                       <p>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): COPPA puts parents in control of the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. It requires operators of websites and online services to protect children's privacy and safety online. Users can refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for detailed information on COPPA and its implications.</p>
                       <p>CAN-SPAM Act: The CAN-SPAM Act sets rules for commercial email, including requirements for commercial messages and recipient rights. Users can refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for guidance on their rights under the CAN-SPAM Act and how to handle commercial emails.</p>
                       <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is a comprehensive data privacy regulation that governs the processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU). It grants individuals certain rights over their personal data and imposes obligations on organizations that collect and process this data. Users can refer to the official EU GDPR website for information on their rights under GDPR and how organizations should handle their personal data.</p>
